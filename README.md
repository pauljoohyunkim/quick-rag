A way to set up RAG with Ollama quickly from a PDF

## Setup
First create a virtual environment.
```
python -m venv .venv
```
Then activate the virtual environment.
This will depend if you are using Windows or Linux.

Install the required packages by
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then refer to `rag_test.ipynb`. It should be very easy to set up.
